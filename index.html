                <h2>Distraction isn't a solution...</h2>
                <p>Whether the choice to browse social media is due to the engaging nature of social media itself, the need to stay connected with others or the "need" to avoid certain deadlines, people are more inclined to spend excessive amounts of time on social media once they have begun to be distracted.</p>
                <p>Social media distraction severely impacts productivity. It takes up limited cognitive resources needed for concentration.</p>
                <p>When multi-tasking alongside social media scrolling, goals are often completed to a lower quality <em>or not completed at all</em> in favour of endless social media scrolling. This can lead to further issues with possible deadlines or general dissatisfaction with personal achievements which can negatively impact other aspects of your wellbeing.

                <p>Excessive social media usage is a temporary solution. Poor mental wellbeing can lead to lower levels of productivity, worsened physical health, sleep issues, impact relationships and incite harmful behaviours on the individual or others.</p>
                <p>The effect social media has on mental health cannot be ignored, whether it exacerbates existing mental health conditions or serves as a starting point for worsened emotional wellbeing. Poor mental health is a spreading pandemic, but preventative measures can help reduce its impact on people's lives.</p>

                <p>The need to constantly check social media often impacts people's sleeping habits. It compels users to stay awake and interrupt their circadian rhythms. When browsing social media at night, exposure to blue light from digital screens affects your ability to fall asleep and consequently your quality of sleep.</p>
                <p>Sleep deprivation has serious consequences: loss of productivity, difficulty with concentration, increased chances of diseases and negative influence on mental health conditions. The domino effect of a consequent lack of physical activity has also been <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-deprivation">shown to increase chances</a> of certain diseases, as well as have a negative influence on emotional wellbeing.</p>
